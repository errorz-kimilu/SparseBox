# SparseBox

On-device backup restoration?

- [x] rewrote SparseRestore to swift
- [x] implemented BookRestore

## Installation
SideStore is recommended as you will also be getting the pairing file and setting up VPN.

Download ipa from [Releases](https://github.com/khanhduytran0/SparseBox/releases), Actions tab or [nightly.link](https://nightly.link/khanhduytran0/SparseBox/workflows/build/main/artifact.zip)
